## Description

Welcome to Blogsville, a web app where you can share your thoughts about everythine and anything. I created this blog to show my knowledge in Express.js, Sequelize, Handlebars, the MVC model of web coding, bcrypt, and sessions. This challenge was hard, considering the fact that it was very similar to my group project. Create accounts, create posts, add comments, and more in this web app.
